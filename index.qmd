## Problem Statement

It is crucial that both patients and physicians are able to use and interpret a LEAP Report to track a patient’s ACLR recovery, though these interpretations are for very different purposes. Patients want to see where they stack up against other people in the recovery process and what time of progress they should be making at this point in recovery while physicians need to track specific details to tailor a recovery plan.

Patients may have a hard time digesting the current LEAP report as it is information dense and does not provide significant context or explanation of the functional and strength assessments and what they mean. While revamping this report will provide clarity for patients, it is also critical to leave in certain features of the report that are necessary for accessibility, organization, and use by physicians. These features include name, date of birth, height, weight, age, the limb that surgery was performed on, and the dates of surgery and tests. Additionally, certain graphs that the LEAP report uses are vital for physicians, but could still be improved for readability and clarity for all parties involved.

## Analysis

To improve the patient-friendliness of the LEAP report while maintaining its usefulness for physicians, we aim to redesign its graphs and layout. Key changes include defining unfamiliar medical terms, removing unsupported standards, and plotting patients as individual points on long-term trend graphs to show their current recovery status and future goals.

A major enhancement involves replacing the arbitrary 90% benchmark with interquartile ranges (IQR) of patient data at each postoperative visit. This functions like a percentile chart, helping patients understand whether they fall within, below, or above typical recovery ranges. Additionally, new graphs showing mean scores for key assessments within “time since surgery” intervals allow patients to compare their progress with other patients and set realistic recovery targets.

## Conclusion

The results of the functional, strength, and physiological assessments presented in a LEAP report are critical in determining whether a patient is ready to return to physical activity. While the original LEAP report may have scored highly in terms of physician utility, its use of medical jargon, arbitrary benchmarks (e.g., 80%, 85%, 90%), lack of long-term data, and poor aesthetic design limited its effectiveness in communicating meaningful information to patients.

Defining terms such as isokinetic, isometric, LSI, and RSI allows patients to better understand and interpret the graphs presented to them. LSI, or Limb Symmetry Index, refers to the functional symmetry between the injured limb and the uninjured limb. In ACL recovery, muscle imbalances and asymmetry are common due to weakness in the injured leg. A low LSI indicates that the patient is not yet ready to return to physical activity. RSI, or Return to Sport Index, is a psychological measure of a patient’s self-perceived readiness to return to sport. The updated LEAP report includes a graph showing the upward trend of RSI scores as time since surgery increases, offering greater context and insight than merely listing the patient’s current RSI score.

The improved report enables patients to better understand the data presented, compare their progress to others at similar recovery stages, and identify target milestones for their next visit. A report that fails to effectively communicate this critical information will be less helpful in guiding patients through their ACL recovery journey.
